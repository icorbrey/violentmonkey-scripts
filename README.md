# violentmonkey-scripts

A collection of ViolentMonkey scripts that I use regularly!

Make sure you have [ViolentMonkey][ext] installed in your browser.

## Installation

Go to your script of choice in GitHub, then click the button marked
"Raw". ViolentMonkey should automatically open it up for installation.
Verify that this is the script that you would like to install, then
click "Install". You're done!
